	cout << "Typhoon Rai, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Odette, is currently a weakening tropical cyclone over the South China Sea which recently passed through the Philippines. Rai became the first Category 5 super typhoon since Nock-ten to form in the month of December and the third Category 5 super typhoon to exist in the South China Sea after Pamela of 1954 and Rammasun of 2014. The twenty-second tropical storm and ninth typhoon of the 2021 Pacific typhoon season, the system originated from a tropical disturbance near the equator on December 9. However, it dissipated on the next day as another area of convection lingered near the dissipating feature that same day. Conditions around the system were favorable for further development, and it slowly developed into a tropical depression on December 12. On the same day, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 1] issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on the consolidating depression. Further intensification ensued, and Rai was upgraded into a tropical storm on the next day before passing south of Ngulu Atoll. After passing near Palau with unknown impacts, Rai entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) by the night of December 14, whereas the PAGASA named it Odette. On the next day, both the JMA and JTWC raised the system's intensity to a low-end Category 1-equivalent typhoon as an eye continued to appear. While approaching the Philippines, Rai unexpectedly rapidly intensified into a Category 5 super typhoon[nb 2] just before its first landfall across Siargao. It then slowly but steadily weakened as it traversed Visayas, exiting into the Sulu Sea. After making its last landfall over Palawan, Rai continued to weaken before unexpectedly re-intensifying into a Category 5-equivalent typhoon by December 18 while nearing Vietnam; it was downgraded once again by the next day. Tropical cyclone warnings were issued for areas in the Philippines and parts of the Caroline Islands as Rai developed. Early bulletins were issued by the PAGASA for Rai, starting on December 12 due to the persistent track of the system towards the country. As the storm neared the country, land travels were canceled, along with flights and ferry operations. People living near coastal areas and into the track of the storm were urged to evacuate. Fishing vessels were also docked into safety and many provinces in the Visayas started to prepare for the storm's brunt. Storm signals were also raised by the PAGASA, first focusing on parts of Visayas and Mindanao, before further expanding into southern Luzon. Food and non-food packs were also prepared by the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) for the evacuees, along with standby funds worth near $15,000. Forced evacuations were conducted as Rai further approached the country, with some people in the Bicol Region being warned of possible Lahars from the Mayon Volcano. A festival in Antique was also affected, along with vaccination drives across the affected regions. Fishing vessels across the coastal areas of Vietnam were moved into safety while thousands of people were prepared to be evacuated due to the storm. Flight services were halted and crops were harvested early.";
